# Bagels Game

Bagels is a deductive logic game where you must guess a number based on clues. This code is created by Al Sweigart and is featured in the book "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python."

## How to Play

1. The computer generates a secret number with no repeated digits.
2. You try to guess the number within a certain number of attempts.
3. The computer provides clues after each guess:
   - Fermi: One digit is correct and in the right position.
   - Pico: One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
   - Bagels: No digit is correct.
4. Keep guessing until you either correctly guess the number or run out of attempts.

## Game Settings

You can adjust the game settings by modifying the following variables in the code:

- `NUM_DIGITS`: The number of digits in the secret number.
- `MAX_GUESSES`: The maximum number of guesses allowed.

## How to Run

Simply run the script in a Python environment to start playing the game. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your guesses.

Enjoy the game!
