# RUNN
It's a pygame-based gaming application that can be controlled and played using gestures rather to a keyboard or mouse. The game's activities are triggered by the user's gestures, which are recorded by Opencv (left, right, bottom, top). In this game, a player must collect flowers while avoiding stones, and his performance will be judged based on his score.
