# RUNN

Readme will be updated soon with required details
The goal of this project is not only to enhance the current game but we contributors can also add new games.
For eg,
Play Chess using hand gestures
Any arcade games using body movements
Musical Instruments using gestures and so on.
A example I would like to add will be a Xylophone which I made few months back, [![YouTubeVideo Id: o6Cnc5S1zg4](https://img.youtube.com/vi/o6Cnc5S1zg4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6Cnc5S1zg4)
