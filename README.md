Readme will be updated soon with required details The goal of this project is not only to enhance the current game but we contributors can also add new games. For eg, Play Chess using hand gestures Any arcade games using body movements Musical Instruments using gestures and so on. A example I would like to add will be a Xylophone which I made few months back, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URfQUlYpwAE&ab_channel=TusharAmdoskar
